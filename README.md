Welcome to our git repo on github. Our repo can easily be cloned, however, permission will be necessary to commit to the public repository located here. You may, however, clone to your own repos and commit to your own local systems.

Have fun and enjoy. Please feel free to contact the Brookdale Comp Sci Club with questions and information on upcoming open source project involvement.
